# LandingPage
ðŸš€ Getting Started
Download or clone the project folder named LandingPage from the CHECK directory.

Inside the LandingPage folder, open the subfolder named latita-landing-page.

In the terminal, navigate to the latita-landing-page folder. If itâ€™s your first time opening the project, install the dependencies by running the installation command (npm install).

After installation, start the development server by running npm start.

If everything is set up correctly, the project will compile and run on your local machine. Youâ€™ll see a success message in the terminal.

Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to view the project.

If you encounter an error like:
"Attempted import error: './components/Services' does not contain a default export",
it means that the Services component needs to be properly exported as a default export in its file.

Once the app runs without errors, the terminal will display both a local and network address where the project is available.

To stop the development server, press Ctrl + C in the terminal.

To create an optimized production build, run npm run build.
